# ePL-KRLS-DISCO (evolving Participatory Learning with Kernel Recursive Least Square and Distance Correlation)

The evolving Participatory Learning with Kernel Recursive Least Square and Distance Correlation (ePL-KRLS-DISCO) is a forecasting model classified as a rule-based evolving Fuzzy System (eFS) proposed by Alves et al. [1].

The paper [1] has a complete review of the eFSs.
